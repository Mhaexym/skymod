# Skymod descriptie
## design philosophy
start on pure stone island with dark cave, large enouth for mobs to spawn
starting on a stone island makes only wood renewable early(with moss) this makes stone a valueble recource
that creates interesting player choises
DESIGN PHYLOSAPHY:
make a flowchart of how to progress, preferable no bottle necks, but multiple paths to important items
there should be adversaty but not tedium, mechanics that are tedious like villiger curing should be a one time thing
Think of 3 archetypes:
- the adventurer (likes one time chalanges, make more bosses)
- the industrialist/exploiters (likes to play factorio in minecraft, make interesting redstone chalanges)
- the grinder/housekeeper (likes comfy tasks that might be repeated, make fun easy playing mechanics)
the mod should have something for each of these archetypes in all stages (early/mid/late) for bouth
 minecraft veterans as wel as new players. it should also encourage cooperation between them by making
 them somewhat dependent on eachothers resource collection, but not in such a way that prograss is to tedious when
 one archetype is missing. (eg, the adventurer can kill phantoms in the early game, the grinder can cut wood
 industrialists are often screwed in the early game) the killing of phantoms becomes more usefull when their
 membranes sell for emerals at wandering traders, making for jolly cooperation. but this is not a neccecity.
These are some dynamics i observe, that should often be encouraged:
- grinders can often do the tasks of industralists by grinding a lot.
   this dynamic creates a relieve when a proces is finally automated = good
- adventurers and exploiters can often do the same task, but the exploiter will have a very methodical aprouch
   think of how some people will just haphazerdly cure a zomby in the middle of the base, while others might make a whole setup
   this dynamic makes it so that different players can get the same progression = good
- housekeepers and adventurers often supply others with tools wich makes for good cooperation
- i think we need more reasons for the industrialist to be usefull for others by for instance making mechanics that
  require insane amounds of items that bouth other player types would like to have very much
  tinkers does this to some extend, building also does this, but often casual builds are not very expensive
  what often hapens is that industialists are the only players that require huge amounds of items, thus they
  end up only industrializing for themselfs
  if trading gets rebalanced in such a way that getting large amounds of some items is very usefull, this could
  make the industrialist more usefull for the housekeeper, who often ends up managing trades
  same goes for making dirt, or other crowable crop land scarse
slowing the base game down is the best way to create interesting mid game chalanges

## To think of:
- maybe add more boss like enemies in the mid game for the adventure type players (think phantom like enemies)
- think of cool way(s) to get diamonds, that require great feats preferably keeping gamer archetypes in mind
- think of how better tools will unlock new tech, go form wood/stone(not renewable in early game) => gold/iron (cheap with nether)
 => lategame diamond
the way these tools create interesting player choise (do i sacrifice precious stone/iron for stone tools in early game)
 is a verry cool mechanic. it should guide the way we think about the stages of the game, but it would also be nice if
 new tools unlocked new tech, e.g. dripstone can only be mined with certain pickaxes, certain bosses are difficult with bad swords
 maybe even add farmland quality: better hoes make better farmland idk
- think of new fun redstone chalanges that can also be done manually by grinders for the lategame (iron glolums break blocks when damaged?)
- maybe add a midgame boss type enemy in the nether, use phantom like spawning mechanism, maybe some sort of ghast king

## To be impimented:

fluid changes:
- water makes no source blocks
- slightly increased water generation from cauldrons in rain
- dispensers can empty cauldrons
- maybe make cobble farming more difficult by adding a small change for lava and/or water to be consumed (also in buckets in inv)
- maybe lava has a chance do cunsume dripstone when it is created in a cauldron, this makes for more interesting
  redstone chalanges
- maybe cobble creation only absorbes lava, but dripstone creation absorbs water, this way everything is downstream from water
- then filling water bottles has a 1 in 3 chance to consume water
- there should be more methods to create water for diverse options that dont all involve cauldrons, maybe extracting it from plants?
- maybe from clouds

creeper fertilization:
- creepers exploding near stone makes moss (early game)
- creepers shot by redirected ghast ball turn netherrack into red nyolium
- charged creeper turns grass into mycelium
- creeper shot by fire arrow emediately explodes
- creeper explosion drop all items
- charged creeper shot with fire arrow can create lava on explosion
lightnign fertilization:
- lightning turnes dirt near water into grass
- lightning turns netherrack near lava into blue nylolium

duping:
- tnt dupe fix (but added potential for creeper blast chambers with fire arrows)
- sand dupe fix

weather totum (early game weather manipulator):
2 logs make nether totum, colour gives certain weather effects more chance
- bright = more sun
- dark = more rain
- very dark = more thunder
every colour works once

drop rebalances:
- unique and/or more drops from all mobs if killed by creeper (turn creeper into industrial component)
- zombies slightly more iron
- drowned way more copper
- husk drop 3-10 sand
- witches way more redstone
- less witches in raid
- pilligers way less emeralds
- pilliger beast drop a progression item in low quantity, to make raid farms stil interesting

(drip)stone:
- gaurdian killed by drowned with tridant has a chance to drop dripstone (to cruel?)
- maybe also obtainable by trade with villiger
- maybe make dripstone a rare drop from minging stone with a new "lucky geologist" enchantment, making use of the altar mechanic
  "lucky geologist" also has far ranging potential for afk farms and other items (maybe based on pickaxe grade)
- maybe add other fancy stone mechanics, e.g. when you push on stone with 2 pistons for 10 ticks, it has a change to turn into granite

trading rebalances:
- wandering trades can be given flowers, making them not despawn
- slightly increased wandering trader spawn rate
- wandering traders buy early game grindable items (think 64 dirt for 1 emerald, or 3 phantom mem 1 em) (no restock?)
- wandering traders still sell saplings (but no dripstone, we dont want to many items from one source)
- villigers no longer sell diamond tools and enchantments, but maybe some others nice items
- pilliger farms greatly nerfed (less witches to incentivise wich farms)
- botanist villiger to unlock some saplings?
- make villiger randomly change their stocks to make villiger searching useless (maybe)

crop rebalances:
- crops can no longer be bonemealed to incentivize large farms
- hunger is more punishing, and respawning does not recover hunger to make early game farming interesting
- maybe add some healthy diet mechanics, so that discovering more food options is interesting

tinkers:
- maybe include some version of tinkers with altered recipies that make more gameplay sence in skyblock, remove vanilla tools.
- tool/armour/weapon smiths could sell random weapons (but not of the best materials)

enchanting:
- in case tinkers is not/only partially used, there should be some sort of early game low lever enchanter,
  craft an altar with iron, cobble and gold (obtainable without nether by hitting pigs with lightning or smelting armour)
  altar gives low level enchantments

potion brewing:
- make potions more interesting so that potion brewing can unlock new tech (think about the progression fowchart)

end_game(haha)/flying:
- new phantom membrane recepy: phantom cloak = 8 phantom membrane, makes slow falling possible (maybe add glider/cape slot)
 slow falling allows for easy downwards building without water, maybe also add some way to temporarily go up a bit to make going down not a suicide mission
- elytra recipy: 8 phantom cloacks, one dragons breath potion
- maybe add bat wings as a fun mid game cloak, and a use for bats
- maybe add hanglider (you know you want to)
- maybe add special cloaks that dont give flight but extra damage for instance

genetic encoder:
- maybe add a tool block that gives the ability to make new plants to unlock them
- alternativelly, add a second composter type, maybe also have that be a source for grass (compost 8 different plants for grass block)

New blocks, sculk goo and end ooze:
- sculk goo is obtained by some process with sculk, and is blue, it acts like honey, but does not stick to honey, slime and ender ooze
- ender ooze is obtained by having enderman pick up some block, it acts like slime and also doesnt stick to other sticky blocks

New blocks, ash and hummus:
- obtained from burning wood (with fire), falls like sand, is maybe 15px high, interacts with water flask to form hummus
- hummus is a plant growable block, jungle trees turn dirt into hummus, similar to spruce podzol
- leaves also have a change to turn to ash when burnt

New plant mechanic:
- every plant has preferred soil that grows it quicker/makes bonemeal more effective
- soil blocks also keep track of moisture, and plants have preffered moisture

soil degredation:
- soil blocks keep track of organic compounds, when these hit threshholds the soil changes:
- organic compound decreases when the same plant is grown twice on one block
- also decreases when block is exposed to rain or water
- increases when a different plant is grown
- decreases when hoe is used
- when dirt has 0 organic compound it becomes sand
- bonemeal increases organic compound
